# Soccer-Finder

Iâ€™m Kevin Wang, a high school student from Wuhan, China. Since many teenagers have difficulty finding a soccer field to play on, I made this program. 

This program includes three functions:
1)	It includes the information of all the soccer fields in my city, including location, accessibility, lighting conditions and grass conditions. 
2)	It includes an interactive function for users to upload changes to the information of soccer fields.
3)	It includes an open space for users to leave messages.

I used Android and Springboot to develop this program.
